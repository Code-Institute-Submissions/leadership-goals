# Milestone Project 1 - Leadership Goals

This purpose of this project is to develop a website that promotes an educational leadership development programme. It is a business to business website as it targeted at companies that are interested in developing leaders in their organisation.
The website will inform potential clients of the content of the programme, provide information about the company providing the course and give potential clients options for contacting Leadserhip Goals about the programme.
 
## User Experience
 
This is a business to business website that provides potential clients with information on the content of the Leadership Goals development programme, the delivery location and the people that deliver the course.

As a manager looking to educate my team, I am able to find out information about the Leadership Goals development programme I am able to quickly find out about the programme's content, where it is located and what are the benefits.

As a potential student of the course, I am able to find out the benefits of the Leadership Goals to both myself and my organisation. I can find our if it is suitable for me and I can contact Leadership Goals quickly.

As a human resource manager of a large company, I can find out information on the programme for the potential development of my company's management team, I can establish the benefits of the programme and I can find out potential study options for my team.

**This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.**

## Features

The project has a clear and simple layout. The header includes a bespoke company logo that I designed using Pixlr, navigation links that underline when hovered over and are bold when active. The navigation bar is responsive and compresses to a burger icon in mobile view with a drop down expansion that is centred.

The main (hero) image on the homepage zooms in on load, the main title is located within a jumbotron that is layed over the main image.

I used a card deck to highlight the stages of the programme on the homepage together with icons. The about us section was originally due to have its own page but it was decided that it would fit better on the homepage itself. This is now contained within a revolving carousel and includes information the company providing the programme including the team, the benefits of the programme and training faciltity.

The footer contains information to help the user

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
Bootstrap
Fontawesome
Google Fonts 
JQuery

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
