# Milestone Project 1 - Leadership Goals

This purpose of this project is to develop a website that promotes an educational leadership development programme. It is a business to business website as it targeted at companies that are interested in developing leaders in their organisation.
The website will inform potential clients of the content of the programme, provide information about the company providing the course and give potential clients options for contacting Leadserhip Goals about the programme.
 
## User Experience
 
This is a business to business website that provides potential clients with information on the content of the Leadership Goals development programme, the delivery location and the people that deliver the course.

As a manager looking to educate my team, I am able to find out information about the Leadership Goals development programme I am able to quickly find out about the programme's content, where it is located and what are the benefits.

As a potential student of the course, I am able to find out the benefits of the Leadership Goals Programme to both myself and my organisation. I can find our if it is suitable for me and I can contact Leadership Goals quickly.

As a human resource manager of a large company, I can find out information on the programme for the potential development of my company's management team, I can establish the benefits of the programme and I can find out potential study options for my team.

**This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.**

## Features

### All Pages
The project has a clear and simple layout. The header includes a bespoke company logo that I designed using Pixlr, navigation links that underline when hovered over and are bold when active. The navigation bar is responsive and compresses to a burger icon in mobile view with a drop down expansion that is centred.

The main (hero) image on the homepage zooms in on loading, the main title is located within a jumbotron that is layed over the main image.

The footer contains information to help the user contact and locate the company. On desktop view, the footer is split into three columns. The first column contains an interacive map which shows the location of The LEadership Goals Centre of Excellence and allows users to get directions in an expanded view through Google Maps. The map does not appear on mobile view. The centre column contains the commpany's address and contact telephone number. This remains centred on mobile view. The right side column contains the company's social media links. These are fontaweosome icons and they change colour when hovered over. The appear at the bottom of the page on mobile view.

### Homepage
I used a card deck to highlight the stages of the programme on the homepage together with icons and text. Each card in the card deck has a hover over effect that shows more information about each stage of the programme in a fade transition on each card. This allows users to get a quick introduction to the programme on the first page of the website before deciding to learn more in The Programme Page.

The about us section was originally due to have its own page but it was decided that it would fit better on the homepage itself. This is now contained within a revolving carousel and includes information the company providing the programme including two cards describing the team, one card on the training faciltity and one card the company's promise/mission. The carousel contains four cards ontained on two slides. In mobile and tablet view these cards become stacked instead of in line on the slides. This section allows users to get a better understanding of the company behind The Leadership Goals Programme through text and images.

### Programme Page
The purpose of the programme page is to give users a greater understanding of the Leadership Goals programme. Below the hero image, I have included a programme schedule on the left column inspired by The Code Institute's resume project. The other two columns include three rows that give an outline and further information on the three stages of the programme that are styled with the projexts colour scheme and include icons from Fontawesome.

The Course Fees section of the programme page gives a brief outline of the courses fee schedule using a Bootstrap Progress Bar that is seperated into three sections. Individual course fees are not provided here but users are encouraged to contact the company using a button in this section that links to the contact form.

### Contact Page
The contact page provides users with a contact form below the hero images that encourages contact with the Leadership Goals Company to find our more information about the programme. The form contains required fields and pop up modal when the Send button is clicked.

A large interactive and responsive map is located below the contact form. The map at this size provides users with a link to get directions to the Leadership Goals Centre of Excellence through Google Maps. The map also allows users toggle between satelite and map view as well as zoom in and out.

Below the map is a small gallery that contains images of the Leadership Goals Centre of Excellence. Each image opens a modal with a gallery carousel when clicked.

## Technologies Used

### Languages 

I used the following languages for the project:
- **[HTML/HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)**
  - The project used **HTML/HTML5** as this is the essential language of websites.

- **[CSS/CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)** 
  - The project used **CSS/CSS3** to provide the styles for the website.

### Frameworks 
- **[BootStrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
  - I used the **Bootstrap 4** Framework to design the website and add useful components and utilities.
  - Within the Bootstrap 4 framework, the following libraries were used to add functionality to components:

### Libraries

- **[JQuery](https://jquery.com)** and **[Popper](https://popper.js.org/)**
    - The project uses **JQuery** to add functionality to Bootstrap's components including Modals and Forms

- **[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)**
    - The project uses **Fontawesome** to add attractive icons to each of the project's pages.

- **[Google Fonts]()
JQuery

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
